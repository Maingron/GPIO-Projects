# GPIO Projects

## Project Info

This repository contains all my breadboard projects. For GPIO access, I use a Raspberry Pi 3. I think it's revision 3B (Not 3B+). Mostly I use Python Scripts. Additional Information will be documented within the files of a specific project.  
I have Git installed on the Pi in order to push changes.  

My Pi's hostname is b001 with IP 192.168.1.81.  
Enabled interfaces: SSH; VNC; Serial Console; Remote GPIO

Project Start: 2021-08  
Maingron

## Dependencies
- Raspberry Pi with: (most projects)
- - Python 2.7.16

## Liability
I'm not responsible for any physical damage caused by my projects, so you should verify before copying a project!  
Of course I try not to cause damage because I want to keep using my own hardware.
